# MUD Engine

A simple (primitive) Multi-User Dungeon engine.

It's primitive because it does not currently support a lot of scripting to allow for a lot of reusability.

Current goal: work on command Parsing.

Next Steps:
 - Build areas
 - Navigation
 - Items
 - Flesh out characters (including inventory)
